# Overwerk - 4 Million

An WebGL particle and WebAudio experiment which visualizes Overwerk's songs. Songs are used by permission.

Particle count is dependent on the selection ranging from `256 * 256 (65.5K)` particles to `2048 * 2048 (4.2M)` texture for that amount of particles

It uses curl noise in 3D radially to project particles and audio frequency/volume to start particles from a initial point .
